        <h4>PRIVACY PROTECTION AND FAIR TRADING</h4>
        <p>We value honesty, fair trading and privacy protection  and so subscribe fully to the Association for Data-driven Marketing and Advertising (ADMA) <a href="http://www.adma.com.au/consumer-help/overview/" class="external_site">code of practice</a> for e-Commerce and direct marketing.</p>
        <h4>NI PRIVACY POLICY:</h4>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy sets out the approach which  <strong>New Internationalist Publications Pty Ltd</strong> - ABN 11 005 523 124 - (NI) will take in relation to the treatment of Personal Information. It includes information on how NI collects, uses, discloses and keeps secure, individuals’ personal information. It also covers how NI makes the personal information it holds available for access to and correction by the individual.</p>
        <p>This policy has been drafted having regard to NI’s obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 (including the National Privacy Principles) (the Privacy Act).</p>
        <p>This policy is a public document and has been prepared in light of National Privacy Principle 5, Openness.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Collection</strong></p>
        <p>1.1 NI will only collect Personal Information where the information is necessary for NI to perform one or more of its functions or activities. In this context, “collect” means gather, acquire or obtain by any means, information in circumstances where the individual is identifiable or identified.</p>
        <p>1.2 NI collects Personal Information primarily for the delivery of NI products and services, and to supply information and details of NI’s products and services. NI also collects and uses Personal Information for secondary purposes including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>accounting purposes</li>
            <li>business planning and product development</li>
        </ul>
        <p>1.3 NI will notify individuals (including, but not limited to, our customers) of the matters listed below at the time of collecting any Personal Information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the main reason that we are collecting Personal Information (this reason will be the Primary Purpose);</li>
            <li>other related Uses or Disclosures that we may make of the Personal Information (Secondary Purposes);</li>
            <li>our identity and how individuals can contact us, if this is not obvious;</li>
            <li>that individuals can access the Personal Information that NI holds about them;</li>
            <li>that individuals should contact NI  if they wish to access or correct Personal Information collected by us or have any concerns in relation to Personal Information;</li>
            <li>the organisations or types of organisations to whom we usually Disclose the Personal Information;</li>
            <li>where applicable, any law that requires the Personal Information to be collected;</li>
            <li>the consequences (if any) for the individual if all or part of the Personal Information is not provided to NI.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>1.4 Where it is not practicable for NI to notify individuals of all of the Collection Information before the collection of Personal Information, NI will ensure that individuals are notified of the Collection Information as soon as possible after the collection. NI will provide “post collection notification” in those circumstances where it is not practicable to notify individuals about the collection of their personal information before it is collected.</p>
        <p>1.5 NI will not collect Sensitive Information from individuals except with express consent from the individual and only where it is necessary for NI to collect such information for an activity or function.</p>
        <p>1.6 NI will not collect Personal Information secretly or in an underhand way.</p>
        <p>1.7 NI will take steps to ensure that individuals on purchased lists are or have been notified of the information as outlined at 1.3.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Use</strong></p>
        <p>2.1 NI will obtain an individual’s consent for Use of non-sensitive Personal Information for Secondary Purposes at the time of collection, unless the Use is a related Secondary Purpose which would be within the relevant individual’s Reasonable Expectations.</p>
        <p>2.2 NI Uses Personal Information primarily for the purposes listed in 1.2 above.</p>
        <p>2.3 If NI relies on the Direct Marketing exception to Direct Market to individuals it will ensure that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>individuals are clearly notified of their right to Opt Out from further Direct Marketing; and</li>
            <li>if the individual Opts Out of all Direct Marketing the Opt Out will be respected by NI and implemented free of charge.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>2.4 NI will not use Sensitive Information for Direct Marketing.</p>
        <p>2.5 NI may use Personal Information to avoid an imminent threat to a person’s life or to public safety. It may also use Personal Information for reasons related to law enforcement or internal investigations into unlawful activities.</p>
        <p>2.6 NI will not use Personal Information without taking reasonable steps to ensure that the information is accurate, complete and up to date.</p>
        <p>2.7 NI will not attempt to match de-identified or anonymous data collected through surveys or such online devices as “cookies”, with information identifying an individual, without the consent of the relevant individual.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Disclosure</strong></p>
        <p>3.1 NI may Disclose Personal Information to related or unrelated third parties if consent has been obtained from the individual.</p>
        <p>3.2 NI may Disclose Personal Information to unrelated third parties to enable outsourcing of functions where that Disclosure or Use is for a Primary Purpose or for a related Secondary Purpose and has been notified to individuals or where such Disclosure is within the individual’s Reasonable Expectations.</p>
        <p>3.3 NI will take reasonable steps to ensure that its contracts with third parties include requirements for third parties to comply with the Use and Disclosure requirements of the Privacy Act.</p>
        <p>3.4 In the rare event that NI is required to disclose Personal Information to law enforcement agencies, government agencies or external advisors NI will only do so in accordance with the Privacy Act or any other relevant Australian legislation.</p>
        <p>3.5 NI may Disclose Personal Information to avoid an imminent threat to a person’s life or to public safety.</p>
        <p>3.6 If a Disclosure is not for a Primary Purpose; is not for a related Secondary Purpose; or upfront consent has not been obtained, NI will not Disclose Personal Information otherwise than in accordance with the exceptions set out at 3.1 to 3.6 above.</p>
        <p>3.7 NI does not generally share its customer lists on a commercial basis with third parties but if it did, it would only do so if we had the appropriate consent of the individual involved.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Information Quality</strong></p>
        <p>4.1 NI will review, on a regular and ongoing basis, its collection and storage practices to ascertain how improvements to accuracy can be achieved.</p>
        <p>4.2 If we no longer need your Personal Information, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify it , unless the law requires otherwise.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Information Security</strong></p>
        <p>5.1 NI requires employees and contractors to perform their duties in a manner that is consistent with NI’s legal responsibilities in relation to privacy.</p>
        <p>5.2 NI will take all reasonable steps to ensure that paper and electronic records containing Personal Information are stored in facilities that are only accessible by people within NI who have a genuine “need to know” as well as “right to know”.</p>
        <p>5.3 NI will review, on a regular and ongoing basis, its information security practices to ascertain how ongoing responsibilities can be achieved and maintained.</p>
